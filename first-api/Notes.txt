AWS Deployment Troubleshooting
------------------------------
Added the springboot jar into S3 bucket for EC2 deployment
 a) Created new role with S3 read access and assigned that role to the EC2 instance while creating EC2 instance
 b) For S3 bucket, provided public access
 c) accessed ec2 instance using putty via ec2 instance's public DNS url
 d) Add security group with inbound rule to allow All traffic (only for testing purpose). 
    This would allow us to connect from any client machine to the instance using ssh in port 22. 
    Also, would enable us to connect to the spring rest service using any http port
 e) Tried to download the jar file from ec2 instance (via ssh) using wget <s3 web url>. getting connection error
    Added the role with s3 read to ec2 instance but still getting same error for wget. 
    Used s3 command (aws s3 cp s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET) from EC2 to copy the jar directly into EC2 instead of using wget
 f) springboot was deployed on port 8080 in aws though bootrstap.yml is configured with 8000
 g) Tried to install mongodb on ec2 instance. but did not have permission to update the mongodb repo on the mongodp repo config file
    hence connected to mongodb atlas which is mongodb cloud environment
 h) configured mongodb to allow any ip to connect to it
