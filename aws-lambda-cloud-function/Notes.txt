AWS needs to understand how to properly invoke our Spring Cloud Function. Spring has a class called FunctionInvoker 
and a generic handler method called handleRequest which is provided by the spring-cloud-function-aws-adapter library.

HandlerInfo to mention in AWS -> org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.aws.FunctionInvoker::handleRequest
