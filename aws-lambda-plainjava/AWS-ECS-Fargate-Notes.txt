How to create ECS-Fargate-Service
*********************************
Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7s-eigrMAI&ab_channel=BeABetterDev

1)Create an ECS Cluster with the availability zones we want to use

2)Create Two Security Group 
  a)One for Application Loadbalancer(ALB) for ECS Fargate service  (For ex: name it as DemoEcsLB-SG). 
  Application loadbalancer is exposed on port 80
    	Add inbound rule for HTTP - TCP - 80 - Anywhere IPv4
		Add inbound rule for HTTP - TCP - 80 - Anywhere IPv6 
  b)One for ECS Fargate Service (This will be using the ALB SG which is created in step 2a
		Add inbound rule for All TCP - TCP - range - DemoEcsLB-SG (ALB SG which is created in step 2a)

3)Create an ALB for ECS Fargate service
  a)With internet-facing, ip address type, with security group as DemoEcsLB-SG
  b)Listener port as Http 80, Target Type as "IP Address" (NOT Instances)
  c)Target protocol (routing protocol) to HTTP and Target Port to 8080 (depends on the port no. on which our app is running)
  Ex: if our springboot app is running on 8090, we should configure the target port as 8090

4)Create an Task Definition in ECS
  a)Provide docker image URI of your application, port no. of the docker container 8080, protocol as TCP
  b)select the CPU, Memory based on your need
  c)Use default role if the task doesn't connect to any other services. otherwise need to create new role with required permission

5)Create an ECS Fargate Service
  a)Go to cluster and create new Service
  b)Application type as Service, No. of desired tasks based on your need, in networking 
  c)Select SG as the one created in step 2b and enable public IP 
  d)Select Application loadbalancer as step3. Create listener as Http port 80 and Target group as the one we created in step2

6)To test the service, you need to use the DNS name URL from ALB (Created in step3)
No need to use the port while using the ALB DNS URL since we are hitting ALB URL
ex app url:  http://demoecsalb-171748391.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/message
where http://demoecsalb-171748391.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com is ALB DNS URL
