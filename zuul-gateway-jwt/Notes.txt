This API/Zuul Gatewy is implemented with centralized authentication and authorization instead of doing authentication in each microservices
All microservices connect to each other via Zuul gateway service. Hence Zuul will validate the token before calling the target microservice

To Enable JWT Token authentication 
----------------------------------
1) Add necessary dependencies (spring-boot-starter-security and jwtt) in pom.xml 
2) Created SecurityConfig file and configured our userDetail service, made it as stateless and added custom filter jwtFilter
3) Custom filter JwtFilter will be executed for each incoming request since it extends OncePerRequestFilter
   a) It extracts the Authorization header from http header and extracts the username and token to validate
   b) It uses JwtUtil to validate the token or create a new token If the token is not available
4) JwtUtil will make use of Jwts to create and validate the token
5) This code uses hardcoded list of users to validate the user instead of connecting to h2 database
